(Not to be confused with YAGPDB, we're completely free to use :P (That's not a dig at them, they have a very reasonable pricing model and their free tier is quite capable. I'm a big fan of YAGPDB. I 100% recommend them if you want a high quality Discord bot, this project is more for fun and is made available if anyone finds utility in it.))",
